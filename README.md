<p>
In the Testout lab, I learned how to set up guest wifi with captive portal for a fictional user accessing to a hotel network I'm working for.
  I logged using default credential and went to click Captive Portal tab on the PFSense website. After creating a name and wrote a description, I scrolled down and configure some changes for concurrent section at 100, idle timeout at 30, hard time out at 120. I also configured under Per-user bandwith restriction and added default download at 8,000 and default upload at 2,500. 
</p>


<ul>
  <li>Maximum concurrent connection: 100</li>
  <li>Idle timeout: 30</li>
  <li>Hard timeout: 120</li>
  <li>Default download (Kbits): 8,000</li>
  <li>Default download (Kbits): 2,500</li>
</ul>


<p>Since this is a fictional simulation I'm learning, this helps me understand how captive portal use to seperate between the guest and employee who are the ones access to the hotel company network access.
Don't any guest accidentally slow the internet down and reasure taking network security and reduce risk that could happen.
